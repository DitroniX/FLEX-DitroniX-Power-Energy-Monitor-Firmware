## FleX - DitroniX Power Energy Monitor Firmware

Development Test and Bring-up Code - WORK-IN-PROGRESS 

Updated 24th July 2025

Dave Williams, DitroniX 2019-2025 (ditronix.net)

## **FLeX Development Code Variants:**

### FleX [ATM90E36]

 - **[EPEM Ethernet Power Energy Monitor](https://github.com/DitroniX/EPEM-Ethernet-Power-Energy-Monitor)** 

	- Features include EPEM ESP32-C6 ATM90E36 RTC RS-485 24C64 EEPROM 3Phase 3+1 CT-Clamps Current Voltage Frequency Power Factor GPIO I2C OLED SMPS USB

## SDK Boards

 - The **[EPEM](https://github.com/DitroniX/EPEM-Ethernet-Power-Energy-Monitor)** Development Code contains a number of features, which may be either used purely for development, a basis for your own firmware, or with features enabled (via software switches), provide a complete firmware solution, publishing to the outside World.

This firmware has evolved over time and although originally was purely for bring-up testing, it has expanded into much more. It has developed way past its original bring-up task and is now quite comprehensive.  It is though, still work in progress and free to be adapted and used.

This test code is OPEN SOURCE and formatted for easier viewing. It may be freely used, or modified as needed. You may use as is, use for bring-up development, simply use the bits you like! final use and for full IoT publishing. It is distributed on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.

**Continual Development**

Due to the nature of this firmware, all variants of FLeX remain under development and is subject to change, improvements and additions.

During any development, the firmware is carefully tested on the range of supported boards. However, should you notice a gremlin, please feel free to let us know!

**Acknowledgements**

Base 90E36 register formulation is based on the original excellent ground work from Tisham Dhar, whatnick \| ATM90E36 Energy Monitor Core. This then being adapted over time where needed.
